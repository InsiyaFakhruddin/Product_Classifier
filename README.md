# 🧠 Product Image Classification System

This project is a deep learning-based image classification system that predicts the category of fashion products from images. Built with a user-friendly **Flask** web interface, it allows users to upload product images and get real-time predictions. The model is trained using **PyTorch** on a labeled fashion dataset.
